A list of scripts i write from time to time that don't fit to a separate repo.

* subextract
Extract subtitles from mkv files.

$ subextract -i mkvfile

The above command uses mkvtoolnix's[1] mkvinfo to retrieve info from the
matroska file `mkvfile'. Searching on this command's output we can see that
there are several tracks. A part of an example output could be something like:

|  + Track number: 4 (track ID for mkvmerge & mkvextract: 3)
|  + Track UID: 3140918427
|  + Track type: subtitles
|  + Enabled: 1
|  + Default flag: 0
|  + Forced flag: 0
|  + Lacing flag: 0
|  + MinCache: 0
|  + Timecode scale: 1
|  + Max BlockAddition ID: 0
|  + Codec ID: S_TEXT/ASS
|  + Codec decode all: 1
|  + CodecPrivate, length 827
|  + Language: eng
|  + Name: English Subtitles

This says, that there are english subtitles in the mkvfile in the .ass format.
The track number for the subtitles according to the above output is 3:

|  + Track number: 4 (track ID for mkvmerge & mkvextract: 3)

We can then extract the .ass file from the mkv with the below command:

$ subextract -e mkvfile output.srt

* bat

Read battery info on a Linux laptop.

* ass2srt

Convert .ass subs to .srt
